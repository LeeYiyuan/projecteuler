/*
    Euclid's formula allows us to parameterize all primitive Pythagorean triples
    (a, b, c) with

        a = m^2 - n^2
        b = 2mn
        c = m^2 + n^2

    where m, n, k > 0, m > n, gcd(m, n) = 1, and at least one of m, n is even.
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple#Generating_a_triple)

    We maintain a list of counts of Pythagorean triples for each of the 1500000
    length sums.

    For each L, we consider unique solutions (m, n) to:
        L = a + b + c
          = 2m^2 + 2mn
          L / 2 = m(m + n)
    For each (m, n), we have a primitive triple. We add 1 to the counters of
    1L, 2L, ..., kL whenever kL < 1500000. This is to account for the non-primitive
    triples, which are multiples of some smaller primitive triple.

    Finally, we count the number of counters for which there is exactly one count.
