/*
    First, we do some algebraic manipulations.

        n = x^2 - y^2 - z^2
          = x^2 - z^2 - y^2
          = (x + z)(x - z) - y^2
          = (2y)(2(x - y)) - y^2
          = 4xy - 5y^2
          = y(4x - 5y)

    We can search through valid pairs of (x, y) and add one to the counter for
    every corresponding n. Afterwards, we count the number of n whose counter
    reads 10.

    Now, we need to specify bounds for our iteration of (x, y). We will pick y
    first and then loop through x for every value of y. Since y | n, we need y <=
    n.

    For every y, we need n to be positive. We can start with x > 5y / 4, or x >=
    ceil(5y / 4). Since z must be positive and z = 2y - x, we have an upper
    bound x < 2y. Furthermore, for fixed y, n = y(4x - 5y) increases as x
    increases. This gives us the second upper bound that n = y(4x - 5y) <=
    n_max, which is 999999 in this case.
