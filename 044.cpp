/*
    We start from p_b = p_2 and move towards the right.

    At each step we find the largest previous p_a such that p_b - p_a is a
    pentagonal number, and if p_b + p_a is a pentagonal number. If there is and
    the difference p_b - p_a is smaller than previous differences, output the
    difference.

    We loop until p_b - p_{b - 1} is greater than the smallest previously found
    difference, because for this b and beyond, the smallest difference of p_b -
    p_a for each b will always be greater than the previously found smallest
    difference.
