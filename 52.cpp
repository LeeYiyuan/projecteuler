/*
    I happen to have been taught \pi ~ 22/7 when I was a kid. I always liked
    to play around with the decimal points of this fraction, and once realized
    that the part 142857 was repeating itself.

    I then realized that a similar pattern can be found in 2\pi, 3\pi, 4\pi, etc
    ~ 44/7, 66/7, 88/7, except the digits are in a different order. It repeated
    on 7\pi.

    So I guessed 142857 and it turned out to work. :>

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << 142857;
