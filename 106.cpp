/*
    Consider a pair of subsets (A, B) with lengths n_A and n_B respectively. If
    n_A != n_B then either n_A > n_B or n_A < n_B and therefore S(A) > S(B) and
    S(A) < S(B) respectively; That is, we only need to check pairs of subsets
    with equal length for the first condition.

    To prevent double counting, we pick pairs of disjoint subsets (A, B) with
    equal lengths such that the smallest element of A is smaller than the
    smallest element of B.

    Notice that starting from the first element, we can "cancel" the smallest
    element of A from the smallest element of B. If we are able to cancel all
    elements, then it is implied that S(A) < S(B) and thus (A, B) need not be
    checked.

    On the other hand, if we reach an index where cancellation can't work (i.e.
    the element of A at that index is larger than the element of B at that
    index), then we know that there is a need to check this pair as it is not
    guaranteed that S(A) < S(B).
