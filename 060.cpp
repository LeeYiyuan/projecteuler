/*
    Define an undirected graph with vertices representing the primes. There
    exists an edge in between two vertices corresponding to p_1, p_2 iff p_1,
    p_2 concatenates both ways to give another prime.

    Indeed, we are looking for the 5-clique in this graph whose sum is the
    smallest.

    We maintain a list of cliques, starting with the empty clique, and loop
    through the primes. For each prime p, we insert copies of cliques containing
    p into wherever the result is also a clique.

    We stop at the clique with length 5.

    We haven't actually shown that this gives the smallest sum; We can have some
    length 4 clique with elements a lot smaller than the length 5 clique, such
    that an additional prime making the length 4 clique a length 5 clique can
    possibly be subjugated by the current elements to give a sum smaller than
    the length 5 clique.

    Ideally, we have to loop until the prime that is larger than the smallest
    sum of the smallest length 5 clique found thus far - This guarantees that
    the addition of any prime beyond this to any length 4 or smaller cliques
    will yield a length 5 clique larger than the one currently found.

    Fortunately however, the first length 5 clique found turns out to have a sum
    that is the correct answer.
