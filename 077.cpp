/*
    Again similar to #31 and #76.

    Let p(n, k) be the number of ways to partition n into parts that are at most k.
    Additionally, each part must be an element of C that contains the first primes
    up to k.

    Each partition must have a maximum value. This maximum value must be an element
    of C (because all parts are in C). We count each possible case to get:

        p(n, k) = \sum_{c in C | c <= min(n, k)} p(n - c, c)

    with p(0, k) = 1 for any k.

    We need the least value of n such that p(n, n) > 5000.

    Luckily unlike the previous #76 the recursion depth here is a low more shallow,
    so the program is still able to terminate quickly enough.
