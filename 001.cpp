/*
    We need the sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

    Consider the multiples of 3 and the multiples of 5. Each set shares a
    particular common subset, that is the multiples of 15.

    If we add all the numbers in both sets together, we would have the sum of
    all multiples of 3 or 5, but the multiples of 15 would have been counted
    twice.

    So we have to subtract off the double count of the multiples of 15 from the
    sum of the elements of the two sets.

    Hence we need

        sum = 3 * (1 + 2 + ... + 333) + 5 * (1 + 2 + ... + 199) - 15 * (1 + 2 + ... + 66)
            = 3 * (333 * 334) / 2 + 5 * (199 * 200) / 2 - 15 * (66 * 67) / 2
*/

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << 3 * (333 * 334) / 2 + 5 * (199 * 200) / 2 - 15 * (66 * 67) / 2;
}
