/*
    Define a digit vector v_n of a number n as a length 10 tuple where v_i is
    the number of occurences of the digit i in n, where leading zeros are
    ignored. Define the count of v_n to be the sum of the elements in v_n, which
    is exactly the number of digits in n.

    We maintain a map of digit vectors to a (count, min_cube) pair. For every
    cube n^3 starting from n = 1, we update the map entry corresponding to v_n
    by incrementing count by 1 and setting min_cube to the the minimum between
    the previous value of min_cube and n^3. Equivalently, since n is increasing,
    we record the min_cube of every digit vector as the first n^3 with that
    digit vector.

    We stop when we get a digit vector with count = 5.

    Notice that we have not shown that the digit vector whose count first
    reaches 5 gives the min_cube that is minimal across all digit vectors whose
    count will subsequently reach 5. In fact, we haven't even shown that the
    digit vector count will remain at exactly 5 and not grow anymore (there
    could be larger cubes with the same digit vector)!

    Fortunately however, the first digit vector whose count hits 5 has min_cube
    that is the correct answer.
